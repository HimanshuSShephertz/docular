<div class="description"><p>Sets the form to its pristine state.</p>

<p>This method can be called to remove the 'ng-dirty' class and set the form to its pristine
state (ng-pristine class). This method will also propagate to all the controls contained
in this form.</p>

<p>Setting a form back to a pristine state is often useful when we want to 'reuse' a form after
saving or resetting it.</p></div>
