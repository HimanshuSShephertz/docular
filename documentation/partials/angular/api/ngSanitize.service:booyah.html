<div class="description"><p>The input is sanitized by parsing the html into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
browser, won't make it through the sanitizer.</p></div>
