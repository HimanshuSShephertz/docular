<p>With the basis of the @doc plugin along with the additions of the @ngdoc plugin gives the final logic to parse, maniuplate, and display documentation just the way it is done on the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/">AngulerJS documentation site</a>.</p>

<p>If you want more info on the AngularJS @ngdoc API <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/">go here!</a>.</p>

<h2 id="otherdocumentationplugins">Other Documentation Plugins?</h4>

<p>Well, there aren't any yet, but if you are feeling frisky, you can certainly make your own. The documentation for creating a documentation plugin is <a href="documentation/docular/apisyntax/booyah">here</a>. (not done yet)</p>

<p>As new plugins become available they will have their own documentation identifier that must take the form "@doc-somename". So suppose I wanted to create my own plugin to parse, manipulate, and display documentation for PHP.  The plugin could specify that it's documentation identifier would be "@doc-php".  Then all documentation would be scanned and if the documentation section had an identifier of "@doc-php" it would use the API that results from the new plugin that inherited from the default "@doc" api.</p>
